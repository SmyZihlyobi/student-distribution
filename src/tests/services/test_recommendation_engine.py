# For Student/Project, if they are SQLAlchemy models, they might need to be instantiated differently

# Assuming they are simple Pydantic models or dataclasses for now.
# Added project_id, company_id, etc. to Project and Student to match common model definitions.
# Corrected import for ProjectRepository.
# Renamed mock_recommendation_service to mock_model_service to align with engine parameter.
# Added type hints to fixtures and test function arguments for clarity.
# Added more test cases: student stack empty string, no active projects, no scores from model, rounding.
# Added some missing attributes to Student/Project instantiation for completeness.
# Corrected `predict_for_student` call assertion in basic flow test.
# Corrected logic in `test_rounding_of_scores` for `bonus_per_match_custom`.
# Added a length check for decimal places in rounding test, though direct comparison of rounded values is primary.
# The `test_candidate_pool_size_logic` is more of a placeholder as direct assertion of internal list size is tricky.
# It primarily ensures the code runs with different numbers of projects.
# Added `required_roles` and `description` to Project instantiations for completeness.
# Added `student_id`, `user_id`, `description` to Student instantiations.
# Corrected `db.project_repository` to `src.db.project_repository` (assuming based on other paths).
# Oh, the prompt used `db.project_repository`. I'll stick to that if it's intentional.
# Let me check the original file structure given in previous prompts.
# The prompt for step 1 showed "from db.project_repository import ProjectRepository". I'll use that.
# The prompt for step 1 showed "from db.student_repository import StudentRepository". I'll use that.
# The prompt for step 1 showed "from db.models import Student, Project". I'll use that.
# The prompt for step 1 showed "from .recommendation_service import RecommendationService, parse_string" in engine.
# So, `RecommendationService` is `src.services.recommendation_service.RecommendationService`.
# And `parse_string` is `src.services.recommendation_service.parse_string`.
# The fixture mock should be `spec=src.services.recommendation_service.RecommendationService`.
# The import for `parse_string` in the test file is mostly for test data setup if needed, engine uses its own import.

# Final check on imports in test file:
# `from src.services.recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine` - OK
# `from src.services.recommendation_service import RecommendationService, parse_string` - OK (service for spec, parse_string if tests need it)
# `from src.db.models import Student, Project` - This should be `from db.models import Student, Project` if consistent with prompt for engine.
# Let's assume `src.db.models` is the canonical path if the project is structured under `src/`.
# If `db` is a top-level package parallel to `src`, then `from db.models...` is correct.
# Given `src/db/__init__.py` etc. in `ls` output, `src.db.models` is more likely. I will use `src.db.models`.
# Similarly for repositories, `src.db.student_repository` and `src.db.project_repository`.

# Correcting imports in the generated block based on this deduction:
# from src.db.models import Student, Project
# from src.db.student_repository import StudentRepository
# from src.db.project_repository import ProjectRepository
# The fixture for mock_model_service should also use `spec=src.services.recommendation_service.RecommendationService`.
# The provided boilerplate already had `from src.services.recommendation_service import RecommendationService`.
# The provided boilerplate had `from src.db.models import Student, Project`.
# The provided boilerplate had `from src.db.student_repository import StudentRepository`.
# The provided boilerplate had `from src.db.project_repository import ProjectRepository`.
# My generated code has a mix. I will ensure the created file is consistent with `src.` prefix for db and services.
# The line `from db.project_repository import ProjectRepository # Corrected import path` was a note, will use `src.db.project_repository`.

# The provided solution in the prompt uses `from db.models...` etc. I will stick to that.
# This means `db` and `services` are likely top-level importable packages, and `src` is just a container directory,
# or PYTHONPATH is configured to include `src`.
# Let's use the imports exactly as in the prompt's example test structure.
# `from src.services.recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine`
# `from src.services.recommendation_service import RecommendationService`
# `from db.models import Student, Project`
# `from db.student_repository import StudentRepository`
# `from db.project_repository import ProjectRepository`
# This means my `ls` output of `src/db/...` might imply that `PYTHONPATH` includes `src`.

# My generated code for the test file has:
# from src.services.recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine -> Matches example
# from src.services.recommendation_service import RecommendationService, parse_string -> Matches example logic (service for spec)
# from src.db.models import Student, Project -> My change, example had `db.models`
# from src.db.student_repository import StudentRepository -> My change, example had `db.student_repository`
# from db.project_repository import ProjectRepository # Corrected import path -> My change, example had `db.project_repository`

# I will revert to the example's import style for db layer:
# from db.models import Student, Project
# from db.student_repository import StudentRepository
# from db.project_repository import ProjectRepository

# The fixture `mock_project_repo` was `AsyncMock(spec=ProjectRepository)`. This `ProjectRepository` needs to be the one imported.
# The fixture `mock_student_repo` was `AsyncMock(spec=StudentRepository)`.
# The fixture `mock_model_service` was `AsyncMock(spec=RecommendationService)`.

# The dummy attributes for Student and Project (like student_id, user_id, project_id, company_id)
# are assumed based on typical ORM models. If the actual models are simpler, these can be removed.
# The engine primarily uses: student.stack, student.id, project.id, project.name, project.stack, project.required_roles.
# I'll simplify the model instantiations in the tests to only include necessary fields for clarity,
# plus what might be in their `__init__` if they are Pydantic models.
# The prompt's example Student/Project are simple:
# Student(id=1, name="Test Student", stack="python,fastapi", desired_role="dev")
# Project(id=101, name="Proj A", stack="python,react", required_roles="frontend", description="...")
# I'll stick to this simplicity.
# My code added `project_id=101, company_id=1` etc. I will remove those extra fields from the test data setup.
# The `student_id` in Student model is usually the primary key, often same as `id`.
# The `project_id` in Project model is usually the primary key, often same as `id`.
# The engine uses `p.id` for dictionary keys and `project_obj.id`.
# `student_id` parameter to `get_recommendations` is used for `student_repo.get_student_by_id(student_id=student_id)`.
# So `Student` model should have an `id` that matches this.

# Final check of the test file's content before creating it.I've reviewed the plan and the content for the new test file `src/tests/services/test_recommendation_engine.py`. I will proceed with creating this file. I've adjusted the import paths for `db` modules to match the style used in the problem description's example test (e.g., `from db.models import Student`) and simplified the `Student` and `Project` instantiations in the tests to reflect the attributes directly used by the engine or shown in the example.
